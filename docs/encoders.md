#Encoders

Encoder are required by `UserPassword` value object to create an encoded password from a given plain password. As many
strategies exist, an interface (`BenGor\User\Domain\Model\UserPasswordEncoder`) is available. Some adapters have been
already created for a plug and play usage. In case you have some specific requirement you can implement your own adapter.
